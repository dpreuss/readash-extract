# readash-extract
Quick hack to extract existing dashboards from redash and save back into internal Starfish redash format. 

Does not support multiple visualizations for a single query, parameterMappings and does not have the correct order. 

This code should be deprecated once the jira ticket to change to redash8 is in place. 

* Note - could is python 2.7, and can be greatly improved.
